      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>I am currently a student at Thinkful in the Software Engineering program. I look forward to my future in web development, and hope to join a company or project where I can use my newfound skills and continue to grow as a developer. For the past 13 years, I have worked as an occupational therapist, helping adults and children to participate more fully in their daily lives. My former career path has uniquely prepared me for a job in web development in the following ways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Knowledge about design elements that would improve access for people with disabilities</li>
        <li>The ability to communicate and collaborate effectively with other team members</li>
        <li>Experience completing multiple projects under a deadline</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>When I'm not busy learning software engineering, I enjoy mountain-biking, doing yoga, trying out new recipes, and spending time with my husband and dog.</p>
